# The Rent Adda – Smart Parking System

## Overview
Rent Adda – Smart Parking System is a web-based application developed and showcased as a **National Level Exhibition Project**. The project addresses urban parking challenges by providing a centralized platform to discover nearby parking locations, aiming to reduce traffic congestion and improve parking efficiency.

This repository focuses on **databse design, system architecture, and documentation**, following industry-standard documentation practices.

---

## Problem Statement
Urban areas in India face significant traffic congestion due to inefficient parking discovery. Vehicles searching for parking contribute to fuel wastage, time loss, and road congestion. There is a lack of centralized platforms that help users identify nearby parking spaces efficiently.

This project explores a technology-driven solution to address this problem.

## Key Features
- Location-based parking discovery
- Integration with Google Maps API for visualization
- Backend-driven data handling for parking locations
- Relational database design for structured data storage
- Modular system design to support future scalability

---

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **APIs:** Google Maps API  
- **Deployment Environment:** Localhost (XAMPP)  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
