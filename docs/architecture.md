## Overview
The Rent Adda is a web-based Smart Parking System designed to address parking unavailability and traffic
congestion issues commonly observed in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities in India. The system enables vehicle users
to discover nearby available parking spaces while allowing landowners to rent out unused land or spaces
for parking purposes. The project was developed and demonstrated as a fully functional prototype at a
national-level CBSE exhibition.

The architecture focuses on clarity of roles, simplicity of deployment, and feasibility of implementation
within academic and infrastructural constraints. While not production-deployed, the system demonstrates a
complete end-to-end workflow covering user authentication, space listing, discovery, selection, and
administrative supervision
